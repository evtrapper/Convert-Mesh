This was a .ply to .stl program I made when I was submitting for the Vesuvius Project. This would also be good for 3d scanning programs to convert other types of scanned images into useable file types for say fusion 360.

The Binary PLY format is unfortunately specific to the type of program that you might use & so this may skip some details for your .ply file.

If using Visual Studio 2022, go to the Properties pages & go to the debugging tab. and you will want to set your file location to wherever your files are located & what you want the output file to be named.
